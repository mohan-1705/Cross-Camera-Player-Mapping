‚öΩ Cross-Camera Soccer Player Detection using YOLOv11
This project is a part of the AI/ML Internship Assignment focused on Task 1: Cross-Camera Player Mapping. The objective was to detect soccer players from two different camera views ‚Äî a broadcast view and a tacticam view ‚Äî using the YOLOv11 object detection model trained on a custom Roboflow Soccer Dataset.

üìå Objective
The main goal of this task was to:

Use YOLOv11 to detect soccer players in videos from two camera angles.

Train the model using a Roboflow dataset.

Apply the trained model to two real video files (broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4).

Output annotated versions of the videos highlighting detected players.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used
YOLOv11 (via ultralytics)

Roboflow (custom dataset and API integration)

OpenCV (for video processing and annotation)

Google Colab / Local Runtime (VS Code) for development

gdown (for downloading videos and weights from Google Drive)

üöÄ Setup Steps Followed
‚úÖ 1. Environment Setup
Ensured Python 3.10+ and PyTorch GPU version installed.

Installed ultralytics, roboflow, opencv-python, and gdown.

‚úÖ 2. Downloaded Model & Videos
Downloaded the trained YOLOv11 weights (best.pt) from Google Drive.

Downloaded two soccer match videos: broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4.

‚úÖ 3. Model Inference
Loaded the best.pt YOLOv11 model.

Ran predictions on each video frame-by-frame.

Annotated the detected players directly on the video frames.

‚úÖ 4. Saved Annotated Outputs
Saved the annotated results as:

broadcast_output.mp4

tacticam_output.mp4

Each video showed bounding boxes around detected players, confirming that detection worked across both camera views.
